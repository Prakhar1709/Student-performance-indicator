# Student Performance Indicator

An end-to-end Machine Learning project that predicts student performance based on demographic and academic features.  
This project implements the complete ML lifecycle including data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, prediction, and deployment using Flask.

---

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to analyze how a student's performance is affected by different factors such as:

- Gender  
- Race / Ethnicity  
- Parental level of education  
- Lunch type  
- Test preparation course  
- Reading score  
- Writing score  

Based on these inputs, the model predicts the **Math score** of a student.
